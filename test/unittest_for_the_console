Write all unittests for console.py, all features!

For testing the console, you should “intercept” STDOUT of it, we highly recommend you to use:

with patch('sys.stdout', new=StringIO()) as f:
    HBNBCommand().onecmd("help show")

Otherwise, you will have to re-write the console by replacing precmd by default.
